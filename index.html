        Boat: As you walk nearer to the edge, ocean waves clash into the mixture
        of sand and dirt that borders the perimeter of the island. Small, orange
        hermit crabs scurry around the tattered, splintered pieces of Japanese
        cedar wood that were torn out of the main structural build. Like walking
        on little pieces of legos, the jagged rocks and honed wood bits struck
        out from beneath the sand, piercing the bareness of your feet. You climb
        up the wooden ladder that’s perched on the massive but run-down ship.
        The frayed, yellow stained sails barely hang onto the high wooden beams
        and the loudness of the wind that gusts into them is overbearing. The
        wooden planks creak and tremble with each step taken, almost on the
        verge of collapsing. You run your fingers through the white outline of
        the ship, touching unpleasant mold and overwhelming amounts of moss
        along the way as well. Behind the main beam that centers the ship, a
        rectangular door that's centered with a circular window leads to the
        basement of the boat. As you open the door, the sickening stench
        immediately fills your nostrils and the vicinity. The smell only
        heightens the deeper you travel into the unlit and humid lower deck. The
        small circular windows that are evenly spaced apart on both sides of the
        walls are the only light source. Spiders tickle your feet as you trip
        over the stacks of pouches filled with rotting food that are years old.
        Shards of glass from the broken windows, almost invisible to spot, make
        the floors dangerous to roam around.

      <h2 id="p3">
        Forest: As you walk the uneven path, large blobs of dark greens waver in
        the wind. Black coffee colored roots uprooted from the dark soil,
        creating semi circles throughout the ground of dead weeds and dry grass.
        Patches of moss cover the multiple tree trunks while the dead leaves
        crunch as you step further into the dark forest. Organ music whistles
        through the shades of phthalo green leaves with the shivering wind,
        blown from different directions one minute to the next. The dense air
        surrounds you as you walk deeper and deeper, following the untidy path.
        Going under the thick branches, pushing aside the thinner ones sticking
        in your face, and almost tripping over a tree root, you arrive at a
        clearing. A clearing of the same dark soil with dead weeds and dry
        grass. But among those, stood a tree of different shades of pink. Jewels
        of pink crowed the thick coffee branches that stretch across the sky.
        With the chilling wind, pedals of pink flutter in the air, twisting and
        twirling before finally landing. Admiss the pedals’ dance, clashes of
        metal were heard. Getting closer to the jewel pink tree, you see on one
        of the thick branches hangs a metal wind chime or what it used to be.
        With each step you take going closer to it, layers of rust can be seen
        in patches among the metal. Cracks among the wooden parts holding the
        metal chimes together, hanging dangerously on a metal line wrapped
        around the branch.

        Village :As you stroll through the barren streets of this once-lively
        village, a strange feeling of kenopsia washes over you. The wind carries
        with it a screech from the rusty hinges of the once well kept doors,
        piercing through the rattling of barren trees which line the outskirts
        of town. Watch your step as you walk, broken wood planks and shattered
        glass litter the cobblestone road that could have once been smooth. This
        town was not burned like Sodom, nor bombed like Warsaw, it suffered a
        fate much more sinister than the will of one man. Looking into the dirt
        you may miss the sight of the rusted farming tools that once tilled soil
        daily. The brown coating of the tools has made them frail and even the
        thought of touching them might make the handles snap and heads shatter.
        Grandeur was not thought of when this town was created, the structures
        could not have reached higher than the trees. The most surprising thing
        about this city was the lack of life from the ground. You expect ivy
        lining the walls and birds living in the places where there was once
        thatch, but none of this is present, and the area stays dead.

        Hospital: You explore the island and see a hospital with eroding bricks
        and muddled windows. You walk in as a rancid smell consumes you.
        Struggling to breathe, you walk on the sanguine and dirt covered tiles
        and see the blood covered uniforms of the hospital faculty. You go
        further into the building and the stench gets stronger, straight ahead
        you see a bed. The metal bed frame is rusting and you lift up the cover
        on the bed to see a corpse. The putrid smell of the decaying body almost
        makes you puke, the mangled pile of flesh just lying there. As part of
        its skull becomes visible you run away in horror, through the shattered
        glass on the floor, but can’t seem to find the exit. Small details begin
        to make themselves visible, such as the scattered rusting tools and the
        machines having their wires pulled out. As you venture deeper into the
        hellish cemetery you notice a door with the sign ‘staff only’ on it.
        Desensitized to the horrors, you walk in to discover a morbid mountain
        of cadaver, barely resembling the individuals they once represented. The
        realization dawns upon you that a plague has overrun this hospital.
        Leaving you with only one option, to escape.

        Castle: The feeling of the structure intermediate to the island was
        grandiose. Its colossal size was the first thing apparent to you, and
        was clad with ruin and nature. Walking closer, the structure of a castle
        becomes clear. The grass you step on is fragile and dry, akin to the
        village’s wood and structures, akin to the decaying bones at the boat.
        At the staircase, the capstones remain sturdy, although the overgrowth
        of flowers and grass cover them. Inside, the darkness of the structure
        contrasted the cascading light of the sun. The vines overtaking the
        castle bore grapes. The doves and lambs fled in your presence, and sharp
        snapping of dry grass constantly rings in your ear. It is funny, even
        though the bustling nature of the structure has long died, in a way, it
        became more alive than ever. You pick up a rusting iron sword whose
        handle became essentially green. The sun-baked vegetation extended
        upwards to the summit of the structure. The constant clatter of the
        insects and animals adjoined to the scenery. It was peaceful, you could
        see most of the island from the structure’s rooftop.

      <h2 id="p6">
        Cliff: As you walk towards the cliff, you see a wooden entrance gate
        that leads to the top. The wood material of the door was rotten and
        chipped as the color and decorations of the door faded. The closer you
        walk to the door, the older the island seems to be. There was a
        beautiful but old sakura tree; it seemed to be the only thing worthy of
        looking at at the bottom of the cliff. The eerie twinkling sound of wind
        chimes on its branches creates a lonely melody as you make your way up
        the cliff. The ground was covered with dirt, and the blood stained grass
        that rustled as the wind blew through them. The smell of clean but
        suffocating air surrounds you as you travel further up this cliff. At
        the very top of the cliff you see protective fences, though they were
        rotten and extremely fragile. From the top you see a vast ocean
        spreading out into the horizon. The crashing waves sound as if it’s
        trying to once again bring the lively spirit back to this island. There
        is a bright moon, somewhat covered by the dark clouds. As you look into
        a distance, the cold and quiet environment slowly comes to you as the
        blood on the grass seems to spread.
