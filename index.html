        Village :As you stroll through the barren streets of this once-lively
        village, a strange feeling of kenopsia washes over you. The wind carries
        with it a screech from the rusty hinges of the once well kept doors,
        piercing through the rattling of barren trees which line the outskirts
        of town. Watch your step as you walk, broken wood planks and shattered
        glass litter the cobblestone road that could have once been smooth. This
        town was not burned like Sodom, nor bombed like Warsaw, it suffered a
        fate much more sinister than the will of one man. Looking into the dirt
        you may miss the sight of the rusted farming tools that once tilled soil
        daily. The brown coating of the tools has made them frail and even the
        thought of touching them might make the handles snap and heads shatter.
        Grandeur was not thought of when this town was created, the structures
        could not have reached higher than the trees. The most surprising thing
        about this city was the lack of life from the ground. You expect ivy
        lining the walls and birds living in the places where there was once
        thatch, but none of this is present, and the area stays dead.
